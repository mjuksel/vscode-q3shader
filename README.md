# vscode-q3shader README

This extension provides syntax highlighting in a number of files used by various idTech engines.

I made this just for the `.shader` in Quake 3, but almost any file from idTech games share similar layout :)

# Quake 3 `.shader`

```
some/epic/effect
{
	map some/epic/texture.png
}
```

I've enabled the following extensions:

## Quake 3 based:

- shader, shaderx, map, aas

## [ZEQ2 Lite](https://zeq2.com/lite)

- phys, psys, grfx, lfs

## Quake 4

- mtr, mtt, cm, md5anim, md5mesh, script, scriptcfg, conf, gui, def, guide, sndshd, fx, af, efx, lipsync
